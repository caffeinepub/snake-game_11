  "summary": "The implementation successfully delivers all requested requirements for the Snake game. The game is built with React and TypeScript, uses Tailwind CSS for styling with a cyberpunk/neon theme, and runs entirely in the frontend. All core gameplay features are present: continuous snake movement, arrow key controls with direction reversal prevention, collision detection, score tracking, and restart functionality. The visual design includes a cohesive neon/cyberpunk theme with Chinese text, gradient backgrounds, and appropriate typography. One additional feature (pause functionality with spacebar) was implemented beyond the requirements.",
