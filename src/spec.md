# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a playable 2D Snake game with core mechanics, collision detection, scoring, and restart functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement a 2D Snake game where the snake moves continuously and grows when eating food
- Add arrow key controls to change the snake's direction (preventing reverse movements)
- Implement collision detection for walls and self-collision to trigger game over
- Display a score counter that increments with each food eaten
- Add restart functionality to reset the game after game over
- Design a visually engaging interface with a cohesive creative theme using Tailwind CSS

**User-visible outcome:** Users can play a complete Snake game using arrow keys, watch their score increase as they collect food, see game over when colliding with walls or themselves, and restart to play again. The game features an engaging visual design with a consistent theme.
